# WTUNet
First  fully Wavelet Transformation-based U-Net.

## Notes:
We only release the files including main cores of WTUNet, since every other single step for training or inferecing is the same with other U-Net models.
You can freely modify the parameters of WTUnet to adapt to your own work. 

The only additional thing you should do is: use the following command to install python-lib.
```python
pip install pytorch_wavelets
```
